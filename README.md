# animation experiments wiith a pico4wd car from sunfounder 
First steps with micropython and playing around with animations with adressable led stripes. Also playing around with letting ChatGPT creating own light effects which works okay, but fun to watch considering an AI created it 

# To-Do
Still wan't to get mqtt or something else to work, so I can control the light effect (at least on or off) with homeassistant etc.
Might be a good usecase for the car when not driving and just hanging on the wall :D
